# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

<!-- Describe what this project is and where it fits in the Ecosystem Admin organization. -->

## Labels

Issues and pull requests use these labels:

- `bug`: something isn't working as expected
- `enhancement`: a new feature or an improvement request
- `documentation`: improvements or additions to the docs
- `test`: adding or improving tests
- `refactor`: code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `chore`: maintenance and tooling work

The labels are defined in `scripts/labels.json`. To change them, edit that file and run `scripts/sync-labels.sh [--prune] [owner/repo]` (needs `gh` and `jq`); the script creates or updates labels, and only deletes labels that aren't in the file when `--prune` is given.

## Issue template

Issues follow the general issue template, provided by the organization's default community health files (`ecosystem-admin/.github`), with these sections in order: Summary, Acceptance criteria (a `- [ ]` checklist), Additional notes (a `-` list), and References (a `-` list written as `- [Label](URL)`). The template sets no default labels or assignees, so pick the label when creating the issue.

## Branching strategy

The project follows GitHub Flow: `main` is always stable and is never committed to directly. Each change is made on a short-lived branch created from `main`, merged back through a pull request, and the branch is deleted afterwards. The remote branch is deleted automatically by GitHub on merge. The local branch is not: after confirming the pull request was merged, run `git switch main`, `git pull --prune`, then `git branch -D <branch>` (`-d` refuses because squash merges leave the branch looking unmerged).

Branches are named `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>`, e.g. `feat/12-login-endpoint`. `<type>` is the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) type, the same one used in commit messages, and maps to the issue label: `enhancement` → `feat`, `bug` → `fix`, `documentation` → `docs`; `test`, `refactor` and `chore` are unchanged.

## Commit messages

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`, with the same types as branch names and a lowercase description, e.g. `docs(setup): add readme with project title and description`.

Default to a single-line message with no body and no credit or trailer lines (no `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with" attribution). Only add a multi-line body, after a blank line, when a commit is complicated enough to need an explanation of what changed and why.

Pull requests are squash-merged (the only merge method allowed), so the pull request title becomes the commit on `main` and must follow the same Conventional Commits format. Commits on the branch don't need to be split in any particular way. Keep one logical change per pull request.

## Pull request template

Pull requests follow the pull request template, also provided by the organization's default community health files, with these sections in order: Summary, Changes (a `-` list), Related issues (`Closes #N`, plus other links as `- [Label](URL)`) and Additional notes. The pull request body becomes the squash commit body on `main`, so keep it concise and delete empty sections and unfilled placeholders such as a bare `Closes #`.
